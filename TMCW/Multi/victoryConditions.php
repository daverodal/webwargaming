                <li> The Loyalist players units are already setup.</li>
                <li>The Rebel Player places their units on the first turn. They will appear in a box labeled Deploy/Staging.
                    The placement of the non airborne unit will determine where the beachheads appear. Beachhead hexes are
                    where supply and non airborne reinforcements appear.</li>
                <li>
                    Airborne units once places will create a air landing zone. Air landing zones are where airborne supply and
                    reinforcements appear.
